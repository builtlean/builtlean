Marc's BuiltLean System produces amazing, mind-blowing results!
Within 8 weeks, I lost a ton of body fat and gained solid muscle. I had put on the pounds
from unhealthy eating and working long hours behind a desk in Consulting and Banking.
A few months later, I got washboard six pack abs!  Overall, I 
dropped down from 23% body fat to 6% body fat.  I'm in my
30's and I'm in the best shape of my life thanks to BuiltLean.

I'd tried weight training the last few years and would get
 some results, but then I would plateau and not go to the
 next level.  Using the BuiltLean Program, I was consistently
 getting stronger and after 8 weeks, my body completely
 transformed.

The BuiltLean Program helped me lose 10lbs of fat, drop 
 3 inches off my waist, from 34 inches to 31, and I now 
 have 10x more energy than I did before. The workouts are
 always changing. It keeps you motivated so you never get
 bored. It's definitely worth the money. It's definitely worth
 the time I invested.  You can clearly see from the results
 you get.  Even within a few weeks, I was seeing dramatic
 results! <img src="http://www.builtlean.com/wp-content/themes/builtlean/images/quote_bottom.png" width="10" height="7" alt="quote_bottom" align="absmiddle" />

When I first started Marc's program, I was completely out of shape and didn't know the first thing about the gym.  Now I'm down to 14% body fat and I'm in the best shape of my life.

I'm a busy guy and my work schedule is hectic, so the short, efficient workouts he designed for me work perfectly.  He also taught me a tremendous amount about nutrition, so I now know what to eat and how to eat on a daily basis.    

Marc did an awesome job at putting the whole package together: from stretching, to my diet, to getting better sleep, to going to the gym, my whole lifestyle has changed.

I've tried working out on my own and always thought this was the time I would actually follow my own guidelines and get in shape.  Each and every time, I failed, which left me discouraged and disappointed. 

With BuiltLean, there was no question of what I should be doing or what I should be eating. Although the diet plan was highly structured, it was flexible as well and I didn't feel like I was breaking a rule having a slice of birthday cake. 

Another aspect of the program that helped dramatically was the motivation it gave me. Mentally, I felt propelled to succeed and when I stumbled, or felt distracted, I turned to the BuiltLean program to find my motivation again."

<b>The result was 30lbs of fat loss in three months and I'm still going strong!</b>

What BuiltLean did for me more than anything else was educate and inform me in a way that I hadn't been before. This knowledge really focused my efforts (both in the gym and nutrition-wise). It empowered me. 

I realized that being in good shape wasn't about luck, or putting a lot of wasted energy into something and hoping for the best. It was about knowing for a fact that I'd get the results I wanted if I just put in the required effort. It served as a way to hold me more accountable for decisions regarding my health and well being.

After trying to improve my body through diet an exercise with subpar results, I decided to seek the help of a fitness professional. Marc provided me with the BuiltLean Program, which allowed me to still enjoy my time off.
I quickly lost 18 lbs of fat and dramatically improved my strength. I can run longer, lift more, and at 30 years old, I'm in the best shape of my life.

I felt unhealthy and unfit from many years of poor eating and lack of exercise.  After 8 weeks with the BuiltLean Program, my weight went from 227lb to 207lb, my waist from 42 inches to 36 inches, and I lost 16.53 total inches off my body.  When I walked to the gym in the morning, I had no worries about what to do, or how many reps I must do, in what sequence etc. Everything was worked out for me. I just had to show up.  If you are on the fence about starting BuiltLean, go for it. It is worth your while 100%! I lost 16 inches off my body in only 8-weeks!

When I started the BuiltLean Program, I was 185lb of pure fat.  Only 4-weeks later, I dropped 30 pounds.  After 8-weeks, I lost a total of 40lb.  My family and friends couldn't believe my amazing transformation.  I actually enjoy working out now because I know I'm going to look better the more I work out.  I have the lean, ripped body I always dreamed about. I used to be fat, now I have a six pack!
